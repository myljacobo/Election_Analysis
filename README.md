## Challenge Summary

### Election-Audit Summary
Here you have the election audit of your recent local congressional election. Fortunately, this election audit can be used-with some modifications-for any election you choose in the future. For example, if you wanted to run this for a mayoral or presidential election, the same concepts would be applied. If the information was provided, the data could be analyzed to show the amount of early voting votes and actual election day results.
